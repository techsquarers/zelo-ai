"""This Python function, generate_daily_tasks, is a rule-based task generator that acts as the core business logic (MVP) for creating tailored, daily learning actions. It links a user's onboarding profile constraints to the specific phase they are currently working on in their curriculum.
Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how the engine dynamically builds a day's itinerary:
------------------------------
## ⏱️ 1. Dynamic Sizing (Calculating num_tasks)
The function reads daily_hours from the user's profile and uses conditional rules to determine how many tasks they can reasonably complete in a day without burnout:

* $\le$ 1.5 hours: Assigns 3 tasks.
* 1.5 to 3 hours: Assigns 4 tasks.
* > 3 hours: Assigns 5 tasks.

------------------------------
## 📚 2. Connecting to the Learning Phase
It identifies the user's specific roadmap milestone using roadmap_phases[current_phase] and pulls out its specific focus_areas. If none are explicitly provided, it safely defaults to "DSA".
------------------------------
## 🛠️ 3. Rules-Based Adaptive Task Generation
The engine constructs an array of tasks sequentially based on user constraints:

* Task 1: Adaptive Learning Component:
* If the user prefers videos: It creates a task to watch a tutorial and generates a dynamic YouTube search link using the active topic (e.g., ...search_query=DSA+Basics+for+beginners).
   * If the user prefers reading: It creates a reading assignment pointing directly to GeeksforGeeks to explore structured engineering guides.
* Tasks 2 & 3: Hands-On Practice Components:
* It generates an unconditional LeetCode Easy practice block worth 20 XP.
   * If the user has enough available daily study hours (num_tasks >= 4), it dynamically appends a harder LeetCode Medium problem block worth a higher 25 XP.
* Task 4: Targeted Weakness Reinforcement:
* If a user has logged specific learning gaps, it intercepts the workflow and inserts a dedicated revision block focusing purely on their top problem area (e.g., "Revise weak area: system design").
* Task 5: Review & Consolidation:
* If the user has a long study block (num_tasks >= 5) or has no active weak areas, it attaches a wrap-up session to summarize notes.

------------------------------
## 🗃️ 4. Clean Slicing Output
At the very end, the function runs return tasks[:num_tasks]. This acts as an automated safety guard. No matter how many tasks were appended by the conditional checks, it strictly clips the list so the final output array never exceeds the calculated threshold for that user's daily study window.
------------------------------
Would you like to write a FastAPI service layer method that hooks this function up to automatically save these generated items into the DailyPlan and Task database tables?
